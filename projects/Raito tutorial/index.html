        <h1>Chapter 1 basic grammar</h1>
        <p>Hi there! This is the first chapter of my conlang, Raito. Let's start by looking at the sentence <span class="lang">Mok ry ka</span>. It means <span class="eng">I jump</span>.

            Let's break it down. The word <span class="lang">ry</span> means <span class="eng">I</span>, and <span class="lang">ka</span> means <span class="eng">jump</span>. But the word <span class="lang">mok</span> is a bit different. It's a "tense word" that indicates the time frame of the action.
            
 Describing an action taking place in the present.
        </p>
        <p>
            what is <span class="eng">i jump</span> in raito? 
            <input type="text" id="c1-easy" placeholder="Submit answer here..."> <button onclick='check("c1-easy", "mok ry ka")'>Check</button>
        </p>
        <p>
        If i told you <span class="lang">ma</span> was the past tense word. what do you think <span class="eng">i jumped</span> whould be in raito? 
        <input type="text" id="c1-medium" placeholder="Submit answer here..."> <button onclick='check("c1-medium", "ma ry ka")'>Check</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        What do you think the future tense is in raito? <span class="eng">Hint: it ends with the letter o.</span><br>
        <input type="text" id="c1-hard" placeholder="Submit answer here..."> <button onclick='check("c1-hard", "mo")'>Check</button>
    </p>
    <p>Lets learn some more words. <span class="eng">say</span>
         is <span class="lang">nymne</span>. so <span class="eng">
            i say</span> whould be <br><span class="lang">mok ry nymne</span>.
<span class="eng">i said that you jump</span> whould be <span class="lang">ma ry nymne mok ly ka</span>.
<br><span class="lang">ly</span> means <span class="eng">you</span>
</p>
<p>in this chapter you learned 6-7 words, depending on if you solved the 3rd question.
    The answer to that question was <span class="lang">mo</span> for anyone who didn't get it.
</p>
