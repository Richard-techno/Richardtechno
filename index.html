        <h2>about me</h2>
        <p>

            Richard Techno is what i choose to call myself on the internet.
            My last name isn't Techno but my first name is actually Richard.
            <br>
            <br>
            The name techno comes from both my love of technology and my liking of techno music at the time of coming up with the name, and ever since it has stuck with me.
            <br>
            <br>
            This website serves as an introduction to me and my "work", aswell as a place where i can share my stuff and/or ask for help!
